## Recent Changes Requiring New Tests

### 1. OperationExecutor Refactoring (Oct 25, 2024)

**What Changed:**
- Introduced `OperationExecutor` as unified background task executor
- All manual operations now use `OperationExecutor` instead of direct `tokio::spawn`
- `MaintenanceService` delegates to `OperationExecutor` for scheduled operations
- Eliminated ~400 lines of duplicated code

**Test Coverage Needed:**

#### High Priority
- [ ] **OperationExecutor unit tests**
  - Test successful operation execution and database tracking
  - Test failed operation handling and error recording
  - Test concurrent operation execution
  - Test alert integration (start, success, failure)
  - Test operation ID uniqueness
  - Test non-blocking behavior (returns immediately)

- [ ] **Integration tests for unified execution path**
  - Test manual pruning via OperationExecutor
  - Test manual snapshot creation via OperationExecutor
  - Test manual snapshot restore via OperationExecutor
  - Test manual state sync via OperationExecutor
  - Test scheduled operations still work through MaintenanceService → OperationExecutor

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Alert notification tests**
  - Verify alerts sent on operation start
  - Verify alerts sent on operation success
  - Verify alerts sent on operation failure
  - Test alert rate limiting still works

- [ ] **Database persistence tests**
  - Verify MaintenanceOperation records created correctly
  - Verify operation status updated to "completed"
  - Verify operation status updated to "failed" with error message
  - Verify completed_at timestamp set correctly

#### Low Priority
- [ ] **Error handling edge cases**
  - Database write failure during operation start
  - Alert service failure during notifications
  - Very long operation type names
  - Operations on non-existent nodes/targets

---

### 2. Background Task Spawning Fix (Oct 25, 2024)

**What Changed:**
- Fixed bug where manual operations left nodes stuck in maintenance
- Changed handlers from awaiting operations to spawning background tasks
- Operations now complete independently of HTTP request lifecycle

**Test Coverage Needed:**

- [ ] **HTTP timeout handling**
  - Test that manual operations return immediately (< 100ms)
  - Test that operations complete even if HTTP connection drops
  - Test maintenance windows cleared after background completion

- [ ] **Maintenance window cleanup**
  - Test maintenance window starts when operation begins
  - Test maintenance window ends when operation completes
  - Test maintenance window ends when operation fails

---

## Test Infrastructure Improvements Needed

### Mock Fixtures
The current `common/fixtures/` need updates to support new architecture:

- [ ] Update `TestConfigBuilder` to use actual Config struct
- [ ] Update `TestDatabase` to provide Database instance (not just pool)
- [ ] Add `MockOperationExecutor` for testing without real HTTP calls
- [ ] Add helper to create test AlertService with mock webhook

### Test Utilities
- [ ] Helper to wait for background tasks with timeout
- [ ] Helper to verify database records with retry logic
- [ ] Helper to assert operation completed successfully
- [ ] Helper to assert operation failed with specific error

---

## Test Guidelines for OperationExecutor

When adding tests for OperationExecutor:

1. **Always wait for background tasks**: Use `tokio::time::sleep` with sufficient buffer
   ```rust
   executor.execute_async("op", "target", || async { Ok(()) }).await;
   sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await; // Wait for background task
   ```

2. **Check database records**: Verify operation was persisted
   ```rust
   let ops = db.get_maintenance_operations(Some(10)).await?;
   assert_eq!(ops[0].status, "completed");
   ```

3. **Verify non-blocking**: Assert execute_async returns quickly
   ```rust
   let start = Instant::now();
   executor.execute_async("slow_op", "target", || async {
       sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
       Ok(())
   }).await?;
   assert!(start.elapsed() < Duration::from_millis(100));
   ```

4. **Test both success and failure paths**: Ensure error handling works
   ```rust
   executor.execute_async("fail_op", "target", || async {
       Err(anyhow::anyhow!("Test error"))
   }).await?;
   // Verify status = "failed" and error_message is set
   ```

## Test Maintenance

**Last Updated:** October 25, 2024  
**Last Full Test Run:** October 25, 2024 (140+ tests passing)  
**Known Issues:** None  
**Ignored Tests:** 15 UI tests requiring browser automation

**Next Actions:**
1. Implement OperationExecutor unit tests (high priority)
2. Update test fixtures to support Config/Database instances
3. Add integration tests for unified execution path
