# Release v1.4.0 - State Sync Bug Fixes & UI Improvements

**Release Date:** 2025-01-18

## üéØ Overview

This release addresses critical state sync bugs, improves path configuration handling, and enhances the overall user experience. All fixes are backward compatible with existing configurations.

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### Agent
- **Fixed: State sync never completing** 
  - The `catching_up` status check was failing due to trailing characters in grep output (`false}` instead of `false`)
  - State sync now correctly detects when a node has finished syncing
  - Impact: State sync operations will now complete successfully instead of running indefinitely

### Manager
- **Fixed: State sync config path error**
  - Changed from `pruning_deploy_path` (which incorrectly included `/data` subdirectory) to `deploy_path` (home directory)
  - Config path now correctly resolves to `{deploy_path}/config/config.toml`
  - Previous incorrect path: `/opt/deploy/nolus/full-node-3/data/config/config.toml` ‚ùå
  - Correct path: `/opt/deploy/nolus/full-node-3/config/config.toml` ‚úÖ
  - Impact: State sync will find the node's config.toml file

- **Fixed: Only one RPC server sent to agent**
  - CometBFT requires at least 2 RPC servers for state sync redundancy
  - Now sends ALL configured RPC servers instead of just the first one
  - Previous behavior: `rpc_servers = "http://rpc1.example.com:26657"` (1 server - causes error)
  - New behavior: `rpc_servers = "http://rpc1.example.com:26657,http://rpc2.example.com:26657"` (all servers)
  - Impact: Meets CometBFT's minimum requirement of 2 RPC servers

- **Fixed: State sync shows as "catching up" instead of "in maintenance"**
  - Web handler now properly calls `HttpAgentManager::execute_state_sync()` 
  - Creates maintenance windows and tracks operations correctly
  - Impact: UI shows correct status during state sync, no false "unhealthy" alerts

### Configuration
- **Changed: Default state sync timeout**
  - Increased from 10 minutes (600s) to 30 minutes (1800s)
  - Rationale: Chains with large state sizes (20-50GB) need more time
  - Impact: State sync won't timeout prematurely on large chains

- **Fixed: RPC server TOML formatting**
  - Removed double-quoting and duplication of RPC servers list
  - Previous (broken): `rpc_servers = ""http://s1","http://s2","http://s1","http://s2""`
  - New (correct): `rpc_servers = "http://s1,http://s2"`
  - Impact: Valid TOML config generation

## ‚ú® Features & Improvements

### User Interface
- **Removed: Active Operations Panel**
  - Eliminated the entire "Active Operations" feature (245 lines removed)
  - Rationale: Feature was unused and cancel button didn't actually stop agent operations
  - Impact: Cleaner UI without broken functionality, reduced polling traffic

### Testing
- **Added: Comprehensive state sync test suite**
  - 14 new tests protecting against regressions
  - Tests cover:
    - Path configuration validation (`deploy_path` vs `pruning_deploy_path`)
    - Config path construction (`{deploy_path}/config/config.toml`)
    - Multiple RPC server handling
    - Error scenarios (empty sources, RPC failures)
    - Regression tests for all fixed bugs
  - Test results: 149 tests passing, 21 ignored, 0 failed

### Code Quality
- **Refactored: Path configuration system**
  - Clearer semantics: `deploy_path` represents home directory
  - Removed confusing `pruning_deploy_path` that included `/data`
  - All operations now use consistent path handling
  - Pruning operations explicitly append `/data` when needed

- **Removed: Duplicate code paths**
  - Eliminated `StateSyncManager` duplicate in web layer
  - All operations now flow through `HttpAgentManager` for consistent tracking
  - Single code path ensures maintenance windows and operation tracking work correctly

### Documentation
- **Updated: CLAUDE.md**
  - Added comprehensive "Path Configuration System" section
  - Examples of path auto-derivation
  - Explains `deploy_path`, `log_path`, `snapshot_backup_path`

- **Updated: README.md**
  - New path configuration examples
  - Updated path derivation documentation
  - Clarified deploy_path vs pruning operations

## üîß Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are backward compatible. Existing config files work without modification due to auto-derivation.

## üì¶ Installation & Deployment

### Quick Install (Linux x86_64)

```bash
# Download manager
wget https://github.com/nolus-protocol/nodes-manager/releases/download/v1.4.0/manager-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xzf manager-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x manager
sudo mv manager /usr/local/bin/

# Download agent
wget https://github.com/nolus-protocol/nodes-manager/releases/download/v1.4.0/agent-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xzf agent-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x agent
sudo mv agent /usr/local/bin/
```

### Verify Checksums

```bash
# Download checksums
wget https://github.com/nolus-protocol/nodes-manager/releases/download/v1.4.0/manager-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256
wget https://github.com/nolus-protocol/nodes-manager/releases/download/v1.4.0/agent-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256

# Verify
sha256sum -c manager-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256
sha256sum -c agent-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256
```

### Upgrade from Previous Version

**Both binaries should be updated** - Manager and Agent both contain critical fixes.

```bash
# Build from source
git pull origin main
git checkout v1.4.0
cargo build --release --all

# Deploy manager
sudo systemctl stop nodes-manager
sudo cp target/release/manager /usr/local/bin/
sudo systemctl start nodes-manager

# Deploy agent (on each node server)
sudo systemctl stop agent
sudo cp target/release/agent /usr/local/bin/
sudo systemctl start agent
```

## üêõ Known Issues

- **Agent operations cannot be cancelled mid-execution**
  - Design limitation: Operations run to completion or timeout
  - Workaround: Let operations complete naturally or wait for timeout
  - Note: Cancel UI has been removed to avoid confusion
